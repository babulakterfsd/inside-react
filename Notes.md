# plan for routing test..

      1. gonna implement routing system
      2. gonna implement login system (if a user is logged in tries to acces a private route, he will be able to visit that page. or, if he is not logged in, he will be redirected to the login page).
      3. user can select random products and order them
      4. after login from the login page, user will be redirected to the dashboard page. if he/she is a normal user, he will see his/her dashboard. If the user is an admin, he will see admin dashboard.
      5. user and admin, both dashboard going to be proteted. no one can access others, anyhow.
